# Keylogger Controller – Internship Project

This project is developed as part of my internship to demonstrate knowledge in Python programming, GUI design using Tkinter, and background process handling using threading.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This keylogger is built strictly for educational and demonstration purposes under supervised conditions. It is not intended for unethical or unauthorized use. Use it only on systems you own or have explicit permission to access.

## Features

- GUI-based controller using Tkinter.
- Start and stop keylogging with simple buttons.
- Keystrokes logged into a `keylog.txt` file.
- Handles both character and special keys.
- Runs keylogging in a separate thread for responsive UI.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Tkinter
- `pynput` library for capturing keyboard input
- `threading` for background task
